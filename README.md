# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Mini Projects

This repository is a collection of my **Machine Learning mini projects**.  
Each project is a small, focused implementation to practice concepts like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, decision trees, and more.  

## ðŸ“‚ What you'll find
- Individual notebooks (`.ipynb`) for each project  
- Supporting scripts and datasets (where needed)  
- Simple documentation inside each notebook  


## âš¡ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To learn, experiment, and share my progress in Data Science & Machine Learning through small, practical projects.

> âœ¨ Stay tuned â€” I'll keep uploading more notebooks here as I complete them.
